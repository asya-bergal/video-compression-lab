Video Compression Lab
=====================

## [Get started](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petersn/video-compression-lab/blob/master/lab.html)

During this lab you will produce a video codec for `libavcodec`, with the goal of compressing test videos smaller than a given size for a given objective noise measure.
To get started, check out [lab.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petersn/video-compression-lab/blob/master/lab.html).

This lab was inspired by (and borrows the CSS of) MIT's 6.824's [second lab](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-raft.html).
